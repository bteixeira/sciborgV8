sciborgV8
=========

An attempt to make a text editor fully scriptable and customizable through Javascript. Makes use of Scintilla text editing component and Google's V8 Javascript engine.

Currently only builds for Linux/GTK. I plan to add support for Mac/Cocoa and Windows, although in the current state it should be eas to adapt.
